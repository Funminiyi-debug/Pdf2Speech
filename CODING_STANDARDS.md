- Always follow SOLID principles and other programming paradigms
- Use the most recent syntax of C# e.g. single constructors should be written constructorless
- always write unit tests for new features
- Don't use tuple response from methods, instead create a class or record for response types
- use consistent variable declaration, if it's var let everything be var instead of say string
- put new class declaration into its own file.
